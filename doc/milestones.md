# Milestones

Major steps:
- [x] React v16.8.1 along with the stable version of Hooks.
- [x] ESlint setup along with a couple of fundamental rules.
- [x] Provide testing with Jest and Enzyme - setup the coverage feedback as well.
- [x] Essential webpack and babel configurations.
- Integrate styled-components.
- [x] Pre-commit.
- DotEnv.
- Create an example for each of the implemented stuff for the explorers / beginners.
- Establish a well-detailed documentation about the packages, useful techniques and tricks to introduce some parts of the project.

Later / future decisions:
- Redux implementation.
- React-router.
- Prettier.
- Make the whole boilerplate configurable via custom scripts - e.g. not all of the projects are running Redux, this is an unnecessary dependency that should be avoided by the aforementioned feature.
- Automatic Heroku deployment.
- PWA.
