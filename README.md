### What the hack is RB?

RB is a simple boilerplate for your React projects.

### There are a bunch of other similar packages.

Eventually, it's true.

### Then why did you create it?

First and foremost, the project is created for particular needs. 

Put simply, this skeleton doesn't contain anything that might be surprising to anyone who is familiar with React. It involves the most basic features that should be included within almost all the React projects.

### The simplicity sounds good. What kind of functionalities does it provide?
- Webpack and Babel
- ESlint
- Testing environment with Jest and Enzyme
- Pre-commit hooks
- CSS loader and styled-components
- Environment variables handling with dotenv-webpack
- Prettier
- Register service worker to support PWAs
- Heroku deployment
- Examples

### Structuring

Basically, I prefer placing coherent files in the same folder instead of creating other ones. Obviously, use your own most preferred style, it's not a law that should be followed by everyone. :)
