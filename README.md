### Introduction

I'm aware of the fact that there're a bunch of other React specific boilerplates that handle the usually included features differently - and even more abstractly. On the contrary, RB serves several
packages along with their basic configurations that might satisfy the needs of a particular group of developers.

What I actually meant with the latter sentence above is that the project contains settings that I use on a daily basis.

### RB consists of the following list of elements:
- Webpack and Babel
- ESlint
- Testing environment with Jest and Enzyme
- Pre-commit hooks
- CSS loader and styled-components
- Environment variables handling with dotenv-webpack
- Prettier
- Register service worker to support PWAs
- Heroku deployment
- Examples
