# RB

### What the hack is RB?

RB is a customizable boilerplate for React projects. Initially this will contain some basic functionalities - such as testing with Jest and Enzyme, linting, webpack configurations and so on - in order to have a structure to either begin your journey with React as a beginner or start up a new one for practice / job.

### Milestones

The first major version should contain the following items:
- React v16.8.1 along with the stable version of Hooks.
- ESlint setup along with a couple of fundamental rules.
- Provide testing with Jest and Enzyme - setup the coverage feedback as well.
- Essential webpack and babel configurations.
- Integrate styled-components.
- Pre-commit.
- DotEnv.
- Create an example for each of the implemented stuff for the explorers / beginners.
- Establish a well-detailed documentation about the packages, useful techniques and tricks to introduce some parts of the project.

Later / future decisions:
- Redux implementation.
- React-router.
- Prettier.
- Make the whole boilerplate configurable via custom scripts - e.g. not all of the project are running on Redux, unnecessary dependency.
- Automatic Heroku deployment.
- PWA.
