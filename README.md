# RB

### What the hack is RB?

RB is a simple boilerplate for your React projects.

### There are a bunch of other similar packages.

Eventually, it's true.

### Then why did you create it?

As far as I know most of the other similar React specific boilerplates contain features that are sometimes being either unused or unnecessary throughout projects. That being said, here is the concept that solves the aforementioned issue:
- First and foremost, establish the basics, for example some files along with webpack that provide the fundamentals.
- Let the user determines the features based on the needs. This implies using pre-defined script flags in order to add extra stuff to the existing project.

### Wow, sounds good. How does it work?

Read the documentation and try it on your own. :)
