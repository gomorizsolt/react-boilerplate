### What the hack is RB?

RB is a simple boilerplate for your React projects.

### There are a bunch of other similar packages.

Eventually, it's true.

### Then why did you create it?

First and foremost, the repo is created for some kind of interests. In addition, I wouldn't like to establish a project each time with the same needs.

In theory, most of the other similar React specific boilerplates contain features that are being unused throughout the process. Simply put, why should we stick to these and leave them inside the project along with their dependencies?

The solution: let the user determines the involved stuff based on the needs. Briefly, create the very basics and extend it with other features whenever it's needed.

### Wow, sounds good. How does it work?

Read the documentation and try it on your own. :)
